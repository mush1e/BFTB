# BFTB - (Backend From The Beginning)

- Just documenting my journey learning backend concepts and their implementations from scratch in go 
- We start with bare bones then graduate to stuff like `net/http`, `net/url`, `encoding/json` and `context`
- then we work on middleware, dependancies and routing

- This is a precursor to my RCE project I wanna build so im just solidifying my basics
